hello all

hi all

good to see everyone who was at the agm at the weekend. what a cracking 
little venue ian has found. thanks for sending dinner with your husband 
zzzzz - it was superb!

the cost for membership is still £12.50 for adults (fyi £9.75 for 
students and £8 for under 18s). for that you get XXX third party public 
liability insurance, a copy of ssssss Magazine and 10% discount at 
outdoor shops - an absolute bargain. fees should be paid by BACS to the 
YYY account, sort code 000000 account no. 11111111 using your name as 
the reference. please let me & jjjj know when you've paid.

the QQQ are running a photo competition this year (closing date 10th 
February) with winning pics for inclusion in this year's handbook. there 
have to be some prizewinners amongst our members...

have just made a booking at Derby hut for February 20-26th in North 
Wales so let me know if you're coming along. we're guaranteeing snow as 
usual. cost is £10 pppn plus a small charge for the wood burner and 
we'll do the saturday night dinner.

hope that's all clear but let me know if i need to clarify anything.

cheers

lllll
